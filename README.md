# Code_Examples

Welcome to my GitHub repository! Here you'll find three folders showcasing my programming progress and personal projects.

py4e_practice - Python Coursework - This folder contains my progress in a self-paced Python course. You'll find a variety of Python scripts showcasing my understanding of core programming concepts and how to apply them to solve problems. Feel free to browse through the files to get a better understanding of my Python skills.

Training_calculator - Training Day Calculator - This folder contains a python application I developed for calculating training days over the course of a year. This app takes user input for the number of training days per week, and calculates the total number of training days in a year, while subtracting holidays, DONSAS, and weekends. It's a useful tool I use for my job all the time. Quickly calculates how many man hours I will have available to me.

Zork_clone - Zork Replication - This folder contains the start of a personal project of mine - a replication of the popular text-based adventure game Zork. Using Python, I recreated the game's mechanics and added my own twists and turns to the story.
