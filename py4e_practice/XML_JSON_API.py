#what do you do with a webpage once you retrieve it
#extracting information on a webpage

#there are two ways to wire transfer stuff across the internet
#XML and JSON
#XML extensible markup language -- more indepth
#serializes and deserializes data -- takes it from one programming language -> breaks it down --> reconsitutes it in another language 
#XML has paths with parent and child nodes, you are able to assinge key, value pairs within the nodes

#XML Schema is how two applications agree they are going to accept communications from each other
#XSD is the largely accepted format

#JSON -- javascript Object Notation
#represents info as dictionaries and lists 

#applications talk to many services on your behalf making use of APIs 
#API stands for Application programming interface
#set of rules that allow you to interact with a service to pick up useful data
